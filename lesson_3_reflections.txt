When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

    When you are working on a project that involves a number of people
    working at different sites. Another reason might be working on your
    own project at different sites.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that you don't get changes from others that could interfere with your
    work.
