When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

    When you are working on a project that involves a number of people
    working at different sites. Another reason might be working on your
    own project at different sites.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that you don't get changes from others that could interfere with your
    work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

    A fork is simply a clone of another persons repository into your github
    account whereas a clone is a copy of your github repository on your local
    machine. A branch is a separate set of files used to test changes or new
    features in your code.
