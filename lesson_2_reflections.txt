What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a repository, git sets up the .git directory with a
    number of subdirectories and files in it. You need to initialize a 
    repository so that you will have a place to store the meta information
    about the files in your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a place where you can combine files that will be 
    committed to a repository. The working directory contains the files
    in the repository as well as other files that may not be a part of
    the project.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

    By using the commands git diff and git diff --staged we can ensure
    that only one logical change per commit. git diff gives the
    difference between the working directory copy and the staging area.
    Once the files that were modified by the logical change are in the 
    staging area, they can be committed using the git commit command.
