What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a repository, git sets up the .git directory with a
    number of subdirectories and files in it. You need to initialize a 
    repository so that you will have a place to store the meta information
    about the files in your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a place where you can combine files that will be 
    committed to a repository. The working directory contains the files
    in the repository as well as other files that may not be a part of
    the project.
